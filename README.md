## BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION:

Human Resource departments manage critical aspects of employee development, performance, satisfaction, and retention. Despite the vast amount of data collected, many HR teams struggle to drive actionable insights that drive improvement. This project addresses that gap by using data analytics to uncover key trends and patterns in employee performance, engagement, and turnover. By understanding these aspects, HR managers can implement targeted strategies to enhance employee satisfaction and overall organisational success.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES:

The Primary objectives of this project are:

1. Analyse Employee Performance: Understand how performance varies across departments, based on tenure, satisfaction, and other factors.

2. Employee Engagement: Examine correlations between employee engagement factors such as satisfaction, event participation, and performance.

3. Predictive Modelling: Build a predictive model to identify employees who are likely to excel based on their profile and engagement factors.

4. Retention Strategies: Evaluate high-performer turnover and propose strategies to retain top talent.

5. Training and Development Impact: Access the ROI of tanning programs by analysing their impact on performance.

6. Work-Life Balance: Investigate the relationship between overtime, absenteeism, and employee performance to promote healthier work environments.

7. Diversity and Inclusion: Assess whether gender impacts employee performance and ensure equitable evaluations.

## DESCRIPTION OF THE DATASET:

1. EmployeeID: A unique identifier assigned to each employee.
2. EmployeeName: Full name of the employee.
3. Salary: Annual salary of the employee in USD.
4. Position: The job title or position held by the employee.
5. State: The state where the employee is located.

## DELIVERABLES:
Upon completion of this project, the following deliverables will be provided:

1. HR Data Insights Report:
- A comprehensive report detailing all the insights derived from the analysis, including visualizations and statistical analysis.
- A section on predictive modelling with feature importance and model evaluation.

2. Interactive Dashboards (optional):
- Interactive dashboards using tools Tableau or Power BI for real-time insights into key HR metrics such as performance, turnover, and training impact.

3. Actionable Recommendations:
- A set of recommendations to HR leaders regarding employee engagement, retention, performance improvement, and work-life balance.
